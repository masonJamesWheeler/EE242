    "1. To check whether the signal is periodic, we need to analyze the individual components of the signal. In this case, we have two components: 2sin(𝜋𝑡) and cos(𝑡).\n",

    "\n",
    "3. The second component, cos(𝑡), is also a sinusoidal signal with a frequency of 1/2𝜋. Its period is T2 = 1/(1/2𝜋) = 2𝜋.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To find the overall period of the signal, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of T1 and T2. Since T1 and T2 have different units and are not integer multiples of each other, the LCM does not exist.\n",

    "2. The first component, cos^2(3𝜋n/4), is a squared sinusoidal signal with a frequency of (3/4)(2𝜋) = 3𝜋/2. So, its period is N1 = 2/(3/4) = 8/3. However, since the signal is squared, it repeats twice in every period, and its effective period is N1' = N1/2 = 8/6 = 4/3.\n",
