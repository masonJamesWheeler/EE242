    "## Assignment 3 -- Analyzing frequency content of a signal\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will use a discrete Fourier transform (specifically, the Python implementation of an FFT) to analyze the frequency content of the 100ms segment of the horn signal from assignment 2. Because this is a periodic signal, the frequency content will have spikes, but because it is a discrete-time signal, they will have finite height. You will experiment with different FFT sizes and different plotting options. The description below assumes that you import numpy as np.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A.** Use the np.fft.fft function to compute the FFT for the 100 ms horn signal, with an fft size of nfft=1024, which you can call **xhf**. Recall that the result of the FFT will be a vector that spans frequencies [0,$f_s$]. If this is a real-valued signal, then the first half of the FFT matters: [0,nfft/2]. In order to get positive and negative frequencies, you need to use the np.fft.fftshift function to get **xhf2**. Create two different plots of the magnitude of result using **(np.abs(.))** in a 2x1 view: one with positive and negative frequencies and one with just positive frequencies. Be sure to scale according to time signal window length. Label the frequency axis in terms of Hz by creating a vector **freq** that scales the FFT index by $f_s$/nfft. The one-sided version should look like the picture above. The two-sided version should be an even function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**B.** It is often the case that frequency content is plotted on a log scale. Again using a 2x1 view, plot the one-sided (positive frequency) magnitude using both linear and log scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "**C.**  Changing the size of the FFT will change the frequency resolution, but it also changes the shape of the result a bit. Just as we saw with Gibbs phenomenon where increasing the number of Fourier series coefficients gave a high frequency ringing at sharp edges, increasing the FFT window will give a “ringing” effect for sharp peaks in frequency. To see this effect, compute the FFT using nfft=2048 and plot the log magnitude compared to nfft=1024, in both cases just using positive frequencies. (The effect is easier to see when plotting magnitude on a log scale.)\n"

Speech is another example: we distinguish different vowels and consonants based on their frequency content.
