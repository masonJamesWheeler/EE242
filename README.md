# EE242 Signals, Systems, and Data I Repository

This repository contains all the work done in the EE242 course at The University of Washington. EE242 is an introduction to signal processing, focusing on both continuous- and discrete-time signals and systems. The course covers basic signals, convolution, Fourier series and transforms, and linear, time-invariant filters. A computer laboratory is included to provide hands-on experience with the concepts.
